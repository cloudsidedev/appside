AppSide is a multitenant environment automation tool based on Ansible.

AppSide is your transparent platform that incorporates the various 
digital infrastructures into a continuous workflow. At the same time, it
creates a consistent environment for the entire development process,
saving time and money. AppSide is an open source developer and DevOps
application that maps the entire development process (continuous
deployment & provisioning) from development to test & staging to
production. This ensures that the systems being managed on the different
infrastructures are deployed in the same way. At the same time, AppSide
creates a consistent environment (on-premise, in the cloud or on bare
metal) throughout the development process. The administrators and
developers (DevOps) can therefore independently control the entire
toolchain. The automation process is created using Ansible playbooks and
contains the admin and developer code, which is stored in a git
repository (encrypted). The code (AppSide) runs on any UNIX-like
operating system where Python can run, including Linux, BSD, and OSX.
Orchestration of the AppSide code requires only SSH access to the
respective systems. AppSide has been designed and optimized from DevOps
for DevOps.

already exist, such as:

-  Load balancing
-  Apache / PHP
-  Web Accelerator / Caching / PageSpeed
-  Distributed file system
-  Master-Master Database
-  Backup & Monitoring Integration
-  Jailkit - chroot
-  ...

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

AppSide is hosted on PiP using python3. ``pip3 install appside`` will
